Executes a given shell command and returns its output.

Usage:
- Each invocation starts a new shell in the tool's configured working directory. A `cd` in one invocation does not change the starting directory of later invocations; use `cd "path" && command` within the same invocation when needed. Shell variables and other shell state do not persist between invocations. Do not assume user profile files are loaded; see the platform-specific shell invocation below.
- IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run find, grep, cat, head, tail, sed, awk, or echo commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task
- Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool which will provide a much better experience for the user:
  - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
  - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
  - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
  - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
  - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo/cat with redirect)
- You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. The synchronous path is always bounded: it defaults to 15000ms (15 seconds) and is capped at 120000ms (2 minutes) — `timeout: 0` is treated as that maximum instead of disabling the timeout, so no request can produce an unbounded synchronous wait. Background tasks (run_in_background: true) run until completion: omitting `timeout` or setting `timeout: 0` leaves a background command without a timeout, and a positive `timeout` (up to 600000ms) requests termination when reached
- When issuing multiple commands, use && to chain them together rather than using separate tool calls if the commands depend on each other
- For builds, installs, or tests that may exceed 15s, set a longer `timeout` value up to the 120000ms foreground maximum. Anything that may need longer, and long-running processes like dev servers or watchers, belongs in `run_in_background: true` — a synchronous command that reaches its timeout is promoted to a background task instead of being killed (see Timeout behavior).

Timeout behavior:
- The synchronous path is always bounded: the effective timeout is clamped to at most 120000ms, and `timeout: 0` is treated as that maximum rather than disabling the timeout. There is no way to disable the timeout on the synchronous path.
- The same foreground deadline covers both shell exit and stdout/stderr draining. `nohup ... &` can leave descendants holding the output pipes after the shell exits; that wait also times out and follows the background-promotion behavior below.
- Foreground timeout returns a timeout error, but does not terminate the process: when background task registration is available and succeeds, the process continues as a background task; the result includes its `task_id`, `pid` and live log file paths. The foreground timeout is not a new deadline for that continued task.
- If background task registration is unavailable or fails, foreground timeout requests process termination.
- For commands explicitly started with `run_in_background: true`, a positive `timeout` requests process termination when reached. Omitting `timeout` or setting it to `0` leaves that background command without a timeout.
- Read the returned process status before retrying. If it says the process is still running, track that task or explicitly stop it before starting a replacement.

Platform behavior:
- Windows: uses powershell -NoProfile -NoLogo -NonInteractive -Command to execute commands
- Unix/macOS: uses bash -c to execute commands
- On Unix, child processes run in their own process group. When termination is requested, cleanup targets the process group; this does not apply to a foreground timeout that continues in the background.
- On Windows, Bash cleanup commands use taskkill for the PowerShell process tree; Unix process-group semantics do not apply.
- The command's stdin is redirected to /dev/null: interactive commands (read, prompts, editors, stdio services waiting on stdin) fail fast with an EOF error instead of hanging until timeout. Do not rely on terminal input; provide input via pipes or files instead

Output handling:
- Output exceeding 2000 lines is truncated (head + tail preserved)
- Output exceeding 65000 bytes is truncated
- Non-zero exit codes are reported
- Both stdout and stderr are captured

Background mode (run_in_background: true):
- Returns immediately with a `task_id`, the process `pid` of the background shell, and log file paths for live output
- Run the service in the foreground inside this already-backgrounded shell: do not add `&`, use `Start-Job`, or detach it with `Start-Process` without `-Wait`.
- Linux/macOS: the returned `pgid` identifies this task's independent process group. Use `kill -TERM -- -<pgid>`, then `kill -KILL -- -<pgid>` only if it remains after a grace period. Killing only the shell PID can leave the service and its output pipes alive.
- Windows: use `taskkill /PID <pid> /T` to target the process tree; add `/F` if needed. If the parent PID has already exited, this cannot reliably find its descendants: use existing task cancellation or identify the remaining child processes. Never apply Unix negative-PID commands on Windows.
- Preserve cleanup errors and verify actual process exit and the background completion notification. Do not hide a failed kill with `2>/dev/null` or report success merely because a trailing `echo cleaned` succeeded.
- Read the stdout/stderr log files at any time (they append while the command runs); monitor status and output preview in the Tasks panel
- The full captured output also arrives via a completion notification when the task finishes
